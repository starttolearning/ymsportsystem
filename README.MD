It is tidious for us to do such additions after each day, even though it is very easy in calcluating but we can not ommite the mistakes. After we found the processes of how it works, we decide to using a programming to solve this problem. Here is how it works:

- Record the details of each item, like name, class, socre, and rank. This is the source of data we gonna to process, it is very important to make sure it corerct and precise!!!
- The program read the data of each item to a variable
- Process it to commit our needs
- Write it out to our needed files

## HOW TO RUN

We use Python to do the hard work and some third party library to make things done. To make it work, you need to install python3, and openpyxl, which you will find in our `requirements.txt` file.

- Clone this repository to your local directory
- Install `requirements.txt` using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
